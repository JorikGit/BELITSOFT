            In 1963, Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge
            to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. From 1979 to 2009 he held
            he post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking received

        <h1>
            My Brief History
        </h1>
        <p>
            For the first time, Stephen Hawking turned his gaze inward for a revealing look at his own life and intellectual evolution.
            <nobr class="bold">My Brief History</nobr> recounts Stephen Hawking’s improbable journey, from his post-war London boyhood to his years
            of international acclaim and celebrity. Illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty and candid
            account introduces readers to the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him ‘Einstein’; the jokester
            who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a black hole; and the young husband and father
            striving to gain a foothold in the world of academia.
            Writing with humility and humour, Hawking opens up about the challenges that confronted him following his
            diagnosis of ALS aged twenty-one. Tracing his development as a thinker, he explains how the prospect of an
            early death urged him onward through numerous intellectual breakthroughs, and talks about the genesis of his
            masterpiece <nobr class="bold">A Brief History</nobr> &ndash; one of the iconic books of the twentieth century.
